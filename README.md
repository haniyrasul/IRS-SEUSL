# IRS-SEUSL

This project explores the use of IRS technology to enhance wireless communication systems, particularly focusing on the 2.4GHz frequency band. The IRS technology employs passive elements to reflect and modulate incident electromagnetic waves, thereby improving signal strength, coverage, and overall network performance without requiring additional power consumption
